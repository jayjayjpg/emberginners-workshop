## What is a Terminal?

A Terminal is a program on your computer that allows you to use your computer, e.g. by running or stopping programs or finding files on it. It is a program that allows you to run, stop and interact with programs on your computer using text-based commands. Similar to how you can use your computer by clicking with your mouse through e.g. your `Pictures` folder or by going online by double-clicking the Chrome icon on your Desktop, the terminal provides you with an alternative way to do all these things in a **text-based** fashion. A terminal accepts written instructions from you to execute on your PC.

The terminal will be useful for you as a programmer, because it allows you to run many programs necessary for building a website which can only be run with written instructions on your terminal. In this exercise unit, we will get more familiar with the terminal on our machine.

By the way, terminal is not the only term with which you might have already heard about this program. Other names commonly used for the terminal are `bash`, `console`, `shell` or `command line`.
