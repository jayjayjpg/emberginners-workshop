## What is Git?

Git is a program that allows you to download, manage and share code more easily than by other means. It is also one of the tools we will use in this workshop to follow the tutorial and to finally also publish our website.


### Checking if you already have Git installed

If you want to check to see if git is installed already on your computer you can run `git` in your terminal. Open your terminal as described in Step 4 and tupe into a new line:

```bash
git --version
```

Hit enter and see what happens:

If it responds with a version number, for example

```
git version 2.21.0 (Apple Git-122.2)
```

you are already good to go without any additional installation on your computer! If it tells us that "git could not be found", then we need to still install it - for installing Git, please follow the instructions below.

### Installing Git

Let's install Git. Visit the [Git Homepage](https://git-scm.com/) and download the installer for your system.

**Note:** if you're on Windows and it asks you if you would like git added to the `PATH` you should say yes.

Once you have installed Git you can run `git` in your terminal again to see if it is there. You might need to restart your terminal (or restart VS Code if you're on Windows)
