## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a run-time environment that is very similar to the way browsers work under the hood when they run programs for websites. We won't be programming using Node.js in the scope of this workshop, but we will need to use tools that rely on Node.js to work on our computer. Therefor, let's install Node.js!

### Installing Node.js

Visit the [Node Homepage](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your system. You will see two options: LTS (which stands for long-term support) and current. For us, it doesn't matter if you choose the stable or the current version - both will work great with this workshop!

After your installation, you can check if everything is installed as expected by running `node -v` in your terminal

```bash
node -v
```

If you see a message describing your Node version, everything's working as expected! If you see a message describing that node is not a program or cannot be find, try the following:

- restart your terminal again for it to pick it up: close the terminal window and open a new one following the instructions from Step 4. Try running `node -v` in your terminal again - do you see the node version in your terminal window now?

- Still no luck? Reach out to any of the mentors to support you with debugging this problem and you will be good to go!
