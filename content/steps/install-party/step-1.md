## How does this workshop work?

This workshop is about learning something new that helps you to explore new interests and provide basic knowledge to continue learning.
What's important in that regard?

- Keep an open mind
- Embrace being patient
- Help each other out
- Ask the mentors all the questions!
- Take a break when you need one
- Celebrate your successes today

Feel free to collaborate with other people in your group. For example, two people can work on a shared computer and you can take turns on who gets to work on the keyboard and who supports on the sideline for each exercise. If you prefer working on your own, this is also great - see whatever works best for you during the workshop!

## Structure

Today we are focusing on getting your development environment setup. Today we will talk about the following topics:

- What is programming?
- What is web development?
- How does a setup for developing on your computer look like?
- How does the web work?
- What is Git and what can you do with it?
- What is Ember.js?

Tomorrow we will go into more detail about web development topics and learn to develop things on the web ourselves. We will build our very first web application and learn a few core concepts of programming in general and about Ember.js in specific.

Overall, by the end of this workshop you hopefully have

-  a better understanding what you can do when programming
-  how websites work and how one is built
-  how you can use your computer to learn programming and build websites
-  how you can use Ember.js to build similar websites in the future
-  where you can continue learning about programming offline and online
