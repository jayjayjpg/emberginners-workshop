## What is a text editor?

A text editor is a program that allows you to write text and save the text in a suitable format, e.g. as `.docx` files. Notable examples of a text editors are Microsoft Word and Notepad. Apart from helping us writing a memo or a book review, text editors can also help us to write software programs, e.g. for building a website.

If you want to build a website, you can write text with the help of an editor, save these texts and run saved files in a browser. This is the general process of programming. We will see how this works in this workshop as well!

Some editors are specifically developed for writing computer programs. They come together with neat features that, for example, help us to read and inspect the code that we're writing with them. To be able to follow this workshop, please follow the instructions below to get a great text editor for programming installed onto your computer.
